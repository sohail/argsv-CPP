"Command-line options represent the \"face\" of the program, and tools for options parsing should be convenient and easy to use.". C/C++ Users Journal November, 2004.

This argsv-cpp is capable of handling short and long commands. It is capable of handling multiple instances of same short or long command. argsv-cpp allows many command names for the same command e.g "?,/?,h,-h,help,--help"(This comma delimited list represents few names of the one single command). argsv-cpp can also process/parse the help text of each command line option.
